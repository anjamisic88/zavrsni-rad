Mastermind Game
The goal of the game is guessing the right combination. There are 6 different characters, and the combination is made of 4 of them, with chance of repetition. After user makes his first choice (his combination), he gets the answer how many characters are at the right place (red circle) and how many characters are are at wrong place (yellow circle). User has six attempts to guess the right combination. 
This is the final project of Front-end development course, so I put the faces of my professors as characters to make it personal. The characters can be changed very easily.
